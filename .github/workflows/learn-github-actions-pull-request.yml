# Used Github Actions:
# - Checkout - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout
# - Setup Java JDK - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-java-jdk
# - Push Checkstyle report - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-checkstyle-report
# - Surefire Report - https://github.com/marketplace/actions/surefire-report
#
# Important notice - this is a separate workflow from "CI" even if they share the similar steps due to the following:
# - "pull_request_target" provides access to github token with read and write permission for code from
#   fork pull request (untrusted source) and shared steps can be mistakenly used on untrusted source
# - used actions as a reaction on "pull_request_target" event are supposed to do only limited set of activities
#   with minimal security footprint (don't cache, don't expose secrets to environment variables, etc.)
# - signing / artifact publishing / etc. should be done only from trusted source (target source of pull request - merged code)
